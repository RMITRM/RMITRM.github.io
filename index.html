									  <p>About Me </p>
									</header>
								  <p>I am from Australia and have also lived in Australia my whole life, though I have<em> </em>visited abroad. I have learned Japanese since I was young, and visited there shortly after completing a short bout of tertiary education in TAFE.</p>
									<p>My education includes graduating standard Australian primary and secondary education, as well as receiving a Certificate IV in Programming and Game Design. As implied by my previous choice of education, I have been very interested in videogames as a media experience since I was quite young. In my teenaged years, I became invested in discovering in how they were made, leading me to experiment with a lot of the facets of their development including art, animation and <strong>especially</strong> programming. I developed my first game, which I shared with my class and teacher at the time, in my final year of primary schooling.</p>

								  <h3>IT, RMIT and Me</h3>
								  <p>&nbsp;</p>
								  <p> My whole life has been spent surrounded by technology,&nbsp; from the hand-me-down PC that my father gave me early in my primary schooling to the personal laptops distributed to my classmates and I during late primary and secondary schooling. Having access to the internet gave my curious young mind the ability to search for elaboration on any little tid-bit that I could think of; fantastic for a child that would always get in trouble for breaking things by pulling them apart out of curiosity for how they worked. </p>
								  <p>In addition to education, technology captivated me through media. One day a friend of mine showed me a game; shortly after which I discovered had been made with an engine that even a 12 year old me could access. Through playing around with visual represntation of programming presented by Game Maker, the aforementioned engine, I was able to very quickly wrap my head around some of the fundamental aspects of coding logic. Since then and as I grew up&nbsp; I have worked on many projects of my own in other engines and languages, as well as a few with small teams.</p>
								  <p>Though I have worked on a few small projects, I've never had the chance to work professionally in the IT industry. Further study seemed to me like the ideal way to proceed, as I have very little formal tertiary education. Due to this, I decided I would begin study at RMIT, given that it both specializes in IT and because it offers robust online educational tools that are very useful with the current state of the world as well as for my own convenience. Through this furthering of my own education, I hope to gain a greater grasp of what the current state of the IT industry is in a more professional sense rather than simply as a consumer. In addition, I hope to further develop my self-taught programming and design skills in a way that better contributes to a professional team environment.</p>

									    <h4>The Dream Job</h4>
									    <p><a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/jobs?job_id=12">Valve Anti-Cheat Software Engineer</a></p>
									  </div>
								  </article>
									<p>The role of an Anti-Cheat Software Engineer involves the development of software counter-measures that are designed to prevent cheating or hacking behaviour in online videogames. The position is one that involves reverse engineering skills necessary to pick apart hacks built around a game engine, in addition to programming skills. This is in order to build safe guards against and enhance the detection of such malicious influence. In addition to these skills, the job necessitates a keen understanding of dynamic link libraries (.dll), excecutable files (.exe) as well as process and memory management; due to these game hacks frequently employing exploits involving the injection of foreign libraries into the executable or the manipulation of the host system's memory.</p>
								  <p>This job interests me greatly for a variety of reasons, both personally and professionally. Personally, the position is enticing due to the fact that it is at a company that I've always enjoyed the work of; Valve itself is a long standing and respected company, and they have an extremely high standard of expectation from their employees. Professionally, the position is one that involves a constant arms race of development whereby the anti-cheat developers must patch up new holes constantly being poked in their software's defenses. This means that the job is one that is always evolving, an endless competitive puzzle of security versus invasion that challenges the engineer to think of new and creative solutions while always considering the potential impact on the honest end user.</p>

									    <p>Reaching the Goal</p>
								    </header>
								    <p>The skills required for the position of Anti-Cheat Software Engineer cover a few broad, as well as many very specific, aspects of IT. Broadly, a bachelor's degree in computer science / engineering is required. In addition to this, five years of real world experience is expected; the fields of which include programming, networking and the development and product launch of software or video games. While I qualify for five years of experience in programming, I am currently still working on my bachelor's in IT. In addition, I have not had any professional level experience developing and shipping software. </p>
								    <p>To rectify not meeting these requirements and become qualified for the position, my plan is as follows;</p>
								    <ul>
									<li>Complete Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology</li>
									<li>Apply for an entry level position in a software development company</li>
									<li>Continue working and developing skills with employment and personal projects</li>
									<li>Build a portfolio of development work, as well personal reverse-engineering projects</li>
									<li>Once well developed enough, attempt an application for the position</li>

									<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
									
									<p>Following are three separate tests that I have taken in order to gain insight into my personality, along with explanations&nbsp; </p>

									    <h4>Myers-Briggs</h4>
									    <p>Taking the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">Myers-Briggs Personality Type Test</a>resulted in me receiving the classification of an INFP, or The Mediator. This classification implies that I would work best in a small group, as well as on a project that I truly believe in and can give my all to. When it comes to team dynamics, it is suggested that my turbulent nature is likely to skew me toward shutting down at the sight of harsh criticism. Potentially, this could also include failing to give it to my teammates where needed; worrying more about their feelings than the work that needs doing.</p>
									    <p>In order to function effectively within a team, I will need to be with other members that are willing to take the time to understand my ideas and handle criticism in an especially tactful manner. On the flip side, I will need to steel myself for potential conflict and try to keep in mind that it may be for the better that there is some internal struggle in order for the group to come to the best possible solution.</p>

									  <div class="inner">
									    <h4>VARK Learning Style</h4>
									    <p>The results of my <a href="https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/">VARK Learning Style Test</a> are that of being a Mild Kinesthetic learner. This means that I am more likely to understand and share ideas effectively with other individuals in a group that also understand things in a practical manner. Combined with my personality type of INFP, this informs me that I will work best with a team that allows me to work on a truly tangible project that can make a difference in some way.</p>
									    <p>Despite being mostly kinesthetic, I have relatively high and comparable scores in both visual and aural learning. This says that I am best when it comes to things that can be pre-planned with design and forethought; as opposed to the more free flowing aural method. Due to this, I might be more useful to a team working on behind the scenes elements for presentational needs, and less useful at communicating as a speaker.</p>

									    <h4>Mensa IQ Practice Test</h4>
									    <p>In addition to the two prior tests, I took a psychometric test from the <a href="https://test.mensa.no/">Mensa Institute</a>. As a practice test, the results should be taken with a grain of salt. It was undertaken for free on the linked webpage, and was not an officially administered IQ test; with only one set of unrandomized questions. </p>
									    <p>The results of my test were obviously surprising, though I found the actual process of the test itself the more interesting part. I had never taken an IQ test of any kind before, and the abstract thinking involved ranged from bafflingly simple all the way through perplexing to the point of having to simply guess. I greatly appreciate the insight that it was able to give me into the way that I think, as well as the different ways that I <em>could</em> think. This test acted as a reminder to me that there are always problems that someone will intuitively understand better than you do, and will serve well as something for me to keep in mind when it comes to working with others.</p>

								  <h3>My Project Idea</h3>
								  <header class="minor">
									    <p>Overview</p>
								    </header>
								    <p>When it comes to ideas for projects, there were a few bouncing around in my head. In the end, I decided to go with the idea that I deemed the most practical in terms of development and real world use. My project idea is the development and launch of a nutrition and meal planning application for mobile devices. This application would be designed with the intent of allowing the end user to quickly parse a few tags through it; returning to them a list of potential ingredients for meals that satisfy their criteria while offering good nutritional value and a bit of variety. </p>
									
									<header class="minor">
									    <p>Motivation </p>
								    </header>
								    <p>The motivation for this idea came from a very personal place. As someone that has had to very quickly take their life into their own hands shortly after graduating from secondary education, I have often found myself being caught up on the little necessities of life. Often when considering groceries, I have found myself lost for what I truly want to eat. I also struggle with knowing if I’m reaching nutritional quotas, and can find it difficult to think of new and interesting things to try when on the spot. All too often, this ended with purchasing the same few things I knew I could count on, boring as they may be. Eventually, this led me to the idea of an application that could quickly suggest ingredients based on a few vague inputs; allowing the user to focus on other important parts of life. </p>
									
									<header class="minor">
									    <p>Description  </p>
								    </header>
								    <p>The product itself will be a mobile application that can be readily downloaded from a device’s native storefront. Once launched, the user will be able to browse through and select various pre-programmed tags for the kinds of food they crave, or the nutritional values important to them. A few examples of potential tags include: </p>
									<ul>
									<li>White Meat</li>
									<li>Gluten Free</li>
									<li>Carbohydrates</li>
									<li>Dietary Fibre</li>
									<li>Whole Grains</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Upon being satisfied with the current selection of tags, the user would submit them. Once submitted, the application would return a list of potential related meals that they could peruse for ideas on what ingredients to purchase. Along with information on individual meals, the application would be able to store a “shopping list”, wherein the user is able to store the ingredients of multiple of their previously selected meals for ease of reference when grocery shopping.</p>
<p>
In addition to the simple display and storage of meals, the application would have the ability to inform the user if it believes they are neglecting any particular kind of nutrition with their current list. This information would be based on a user defined value for how long their groceries are intended to last, from a day to multiple weeks. This setting, along with others, would be stored in an optional part of the application for more advanced users. Within this space necessary options should be included in the end product, such as the ability for the user to define specific and permanent dietary needs; this would include health concerns such as coeliac and allergies, ruling out problematic foods and suggesting more appropriate options as necessary. 
</p>
									<p>
Due to the nature of the application requiring it to be capable of retrieving items based on a tag system, it will need some form of database to retrieve these from. This database should be something openly available for the end user to browse, should they choose to. While browsing this database of food items, the user will be capable of marking specific ingredients as favourites. Any item marked as a favourite will be weighted higher when it comes to recommendations, with related foods also being recommended more often. 
</p>
									<header class="minor">
									    <p>Tools and Technology</p>
								    </header>
								    <p>The successful realisation of this project will hinge on the use of a mobile multi-platform application development suite, of which there are several. The ideal candidate for this is React Native, an open-source Java driven suite already in use globally. React Native allows the developer to write a single codebase containing platform specific code, such that a single project can encompass native support for both iOS and Android simultaneously. In addition to this, while not necessary, access to both Android and iOS devices for practical testing would be a boon towards the development process. </p>
									
									<header class="minor">
									    <p>Skills Required</p>
								    </header>
								    <p>The skills required for the development of this application will largely revolve around the learning of a cross-platform development tool for mobile devices. The majority of these development tools use some combination of Java and CSS/HTML, and such a thorough understanding of these languages will be necessary. The first step toward attaining the skills necessary for this project will be picking which cross-development platform will be used, followed by further study of the language used therein. As I am currently studying the Introduction to Programming subject with RMIT, my grasp of Java will naturally further as time passes. </p>
									
									<header class="minor">
									    <p>Outcome</p>
								    </header>
								    <p>The successful launch of the product will be once it has been shipped to iOS and Android storefronts for download. Once available, the application will offer the ability for any user to quickly and easily determine what kind of meals they wish to plan and why. It should also open the door for users to explore foods they otherwise may not consider; the perfect environment to learn for less culinary inclined individuals. Bachelors, young adults freshly fending for themselves, and anyone that wants to save some money and eat healthier by avoiding fast food will have an easy to access way of saving the time and headache of grocery shopping.
